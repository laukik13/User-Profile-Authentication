# User Management Module (MERN)

The User Management project built with the MERN stack is a comprehensive solution for handling user authentication, registration, forgot/reset Password and profile management. MongoDB serves as the scalable and flexible database, while Express.js powers the backend API, providing secure routes for user data manipulation. 

The React.js frontend offers a dynamic and responsive user interface, allowing seamless interaction with the system. Node.js orchestrates the entire application, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend.

This project aims to deliver a robust and user-friendly platform for managing user accounts, enhancing security, and streamlining the user experience.
