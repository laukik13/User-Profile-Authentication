# User Management Module (MERN)

The User Management project built with the MERN stack is a comprehensive solution for handling user authentication, registration, and profile management. MongoDB serves as the scalable and flexible database, while Express.js powers the backend API, providing secure routes for user data manipulation. 

The React.js frontend offers a dynamic and responsive user interface, allowing seamless interaction with the system. Node.js orchestrates the entire application, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. 

This project aims to deliver a robust and user-friendly platform for managing user accounts, enhancing security, and streamlining the user experience.
